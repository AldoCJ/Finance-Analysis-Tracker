Missing Functionality

- Function that takes a purchase description and returns a category if found, otherwise 
  will label the purchase as "other"

- Find a way to organize data into each month/year
    * This could be done using object orientation where each month is a object
    * same thing could be done for yearly data

- Find a way to store data in a small database 
    * Update this database whenever a new file is uploaded

- Need to be able to upload a file
